DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) is a Python framework for
implementing and experimenting with evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and
other types of evolutionary algorithms. DEAP provides tools for defining your custom evolutionary algorithms and
allows you to easily create and evolve populations of individuals.

Here, I'll provide a simple example of how to use DEAP to solve a basic optimization problem.
In this example, we'll implement a genetic algorithm to find the maximum value of a simple mathematical function.
'''

import random
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms

# Define the optimization problem:
# We want to maximize the function f(x, y) = -x^2 + 5x + 10.

# Define the evaluation function
def eval_func(individual):
    x, y = individual
    return -x**2 + 5*x + 10,  # Tuple with a single value, which is the fitness.

# Create a DEAP fitness class, maximize the fitness value.
creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))

# Create a DEAP individual class with two attributes (x, y).
creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)

# Create a toolbox for creating individuals and populations
toolbox = base.Toolbox()

# Register the attribute (x and y) and the initialization method
toolbox.register("attr_float", random.uniform, -10, 10)
toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_float, n=2)  # Two variables
toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)

# Register the evaluation function
toolbox.register("evaluate", eval_func)

# Register the genetic operators
toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutGaussian, mu=0, sigma=1, indpb=0.2)
toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)

# Create an initial population of size 100
population = toolbox.population(n=100)

# Create the statistics object to record fitness values
stats = tools.Statistics(lambda ind: ind.fitness.values)
stats.register("max", max)

# Define the Hall of Fame to store the best individual
hof = tools.HallOfFame(1)

# Run the genetic algorithm
num_generations = 50
population, logbook = algorithms.eaSimple(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.7, mutpb=0.2, ngen=num_generations,
                                          stats=stats, halloffame=hof, verbose=True)

# Print the best individual and its fitness value
best_individual = hof[0]
print("Best individual:", best_individual)
print("Best fitness value:", best_individual.fitness.values[0])


'''
In this example:

We define the optimization problem as maximizing the function f(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 10.
We create a DEAP fitness class that maximizes the fitness value.
We create a DEAP individual class with a single attribute x, representing the solution.
We create a toolbox for creating individuals and populations, as well as registering genetic operators
(crossover, mutation, selection), evaluation function, and initialization methods.
We create an initial population of 100 individuals.
We define statistics to keep track of the maximum fitness value.
We use the eaSimple function from DEAP to run the genetic algorithm for a specified number of generations.
Finally, we print the best individual and its fitness value, which represents the solution to the optimization problem.

This example demonstrates a basic use case of DEAP for solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm.
You can customize and extend this example for more complex problems and algorithms.
