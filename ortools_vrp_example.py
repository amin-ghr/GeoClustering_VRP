'''
The ortools library, developed by Google, provides powerful tools for solving a variety of optimization problems,
including Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and Constraint Programming (CP) problems. Here, I'll provide two examples:
one for solving a VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) and another for solving a Constraint Programming (CP) problem using ortools.

In this example:

We generate random data for the VRP, including a distance matrix, customer demands, and vehicle capacities.
We create a routing model and register callbacks for distance and demand.
We define constraints, including vehicle capacities and time windows.
We set search parameters and use ortools to solve the VRP.
Finally, we print the solution, including the optimized route and total distance.

You can adjust the number of customers, vehicles, and the generated data to create different VRP instances and
experiment with ortools for solving them.
