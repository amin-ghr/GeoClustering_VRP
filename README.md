# GeoClustering-VRP-GA

This repository contains code for clustering geographical data using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) with Genetic Algorithms (GA).

## Overview

- **DBSCAN Clustering**: The code includes utilities for preprocessing geographical data and applying the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group data points based on spatial density.

- **VRP with GA**: Additionally, it provides an implementation of Genetic Algorithms to solve Vehicle Routing Problems efficiently, connecting locations to cluster centroids.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GeoClustering-VRP-GA.git
   cd GeoClustering-VRP-GA

1. Install the required dependencies (mention any specific libraries or packages).

2. Run the provided scripts for DBSCAN clustering and VRP with GA. Make sure to customize them to your dataset and problem specifications.

3. Visualize the results, and adapt the code to your specific use case as needed.

# Requirements
